Great — let's make your **Enterprise Infrastructure Capacity Forecasting & Optimization System** project even stronger by integrating **real AWS services**. This will directly echo the **AWS, Cloud Computing, Analytics** bullets from your resumes (e.g., G6 Hospitality migration to AWS, Citi cloud-related work), while keeping costs very low with your **$200 credits** (we can stay under $10–20 total if careful).

### Recommended AWS Services Stack (Cost-Effective & Relevant to Your Citi Experience)
We'll focus on **serverless/managed** services to minimize costs and showcase modern cloud skills:

- **Amazon S3** — Store raw + processed monitoring data (CSVs of simulated server metrics). Super cheap (~$0.023/GB/month).
- **AWS Glue** or **simple boto3 + pandas** — For ETL (extract/transform/load). Use Glue Crawler + Athena if you want zero-server ETL, but for low cost, run locally or on free-tier EC2/SageMaker Studio.
- **Amazon SageMaker** — For ML training/forecasting (Prophet/scikit-learn models). Use **SageMaker Studio Notebook** (free tier eligible) or small training jobs on **ml.t3.medium** (~$0.05/hour). Run short jobs (minutes), then delete.
- **Amazon Athena** — Query data in S3 like SQL (great for "Oracle backup DB" simulation). Pay per query (~$5/TB scanned — tiny for our data).
- **Amazon QuickSight** (optional) — Interactive dashboards (like your plotly/dash). Free for authors, cheap for readers.
- **AWS Lambda** + **EventBridge** (optional) — For scheduled pipeline runs (serverless automation).
- **Amazon Forecast** (advanced option) — Fully managed time-series service (alternative/complement to Prophet). Very accurate for capacity trends, but costs ~$0.001 per 1,000 forecast points — test small.

**Cost-saving strategy** (to stay way under budget):
- Use **AWS Free Tier** where possible (S3, Lambda, SageMaker notebooks have generous free hours).
- Run everything in **short bursts** (train models for 5–30 min max).
- Use **Spot instances** or small instances if needed.
- Delete resources after each session (use AWS CLI or console).
- Monitor with **AWS Budgets** — set a $20 monthly alert.
- Data size: Keep synthetic datasets small (100 servers × 3 years daily = ~100k rows → pennies).

This setup mirrors Citi-style enterprise pipelines: data from monitoring tools → S3 → ETL → ML forecasting → reports/dashboards.

### Updated Project Scope with AWS Integration
**Project Name Suggestion**: "AWS-Capacity-Forecaster" (or "CITI-Inspired-AWS-Infrastructure-Forecasting")

1. **Data Generation & Storage**
   - Generate synthetic server metrics (CPU/mem/disk P95 daily) locally with pandas/numpy.
   - Upload to **S3 bucket** using boto3.

2. **ETL Pipeline**
   - Use **pandas** locally or **SageMaker Processing Job** (small instance) for cleansing/feature engineering.
   - Store cleaned data back in S3.
   - Bonus: Query with **Athena** (SQL on S3) to simulate "Oracle backup DB" queries.

3. **ML Forecasting**
   - Train **Prophet** + **scikit-learn** (RandomForest/GradientBoosting) models in **SageMaker Notebook**.
   - Compare with **Amazon Forecast** (import S3 data → create dataset group → train predictor → generate forecasts).
   - Show accuracy improvement (e.g., "Prophet + AWS managed beats baseline by 25%").

4. **Risk Analysis & Optimization**
   - Compute P95 risks, seasonal peaks.
   - K-Means clustering on utilization → recommend consolidations.

5. **Visualization & Reporting**
   - Interactive plots with **plotly** in notebook.
   - Export to **QuickSight** dashboard (upload CSV to S3 → create dataset → build visuals).
   - Generate PDF reports.

6. **Automation Touch** (if time)
   - Lambda function triggered by S3 upload → run simple forecast.

### Step-by-Step Getting Started Plan (Low-Cost)
1. **Set up AWS**:
   - Log into console → enable Free Tier alerts.
   - Create IAM user/role with S3, SageMaker, Athena, Forecast permissions (use least privilege).
   - Create one S3 bucket (e.g., `sean-capacity-forecast-data`).

2. **Local Dev First** (zero cost):
   - Build data gen + ETL + models in Jupyter notebook (like Horizon).
   - Use `boto3` to upload/download from S3.

3. **Move to SageMaker** (~$1–5 total):
   - Launch **SageMaker Studio** (free for notebooks).
   - Run your pandas/Prophet code there.
   - For training: Use built-in scikit-learn container or script mode.

4. **Add Amazon Forecast** (optional, ~$2–5):
   - Follow AWS docs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/what-is-forecast.html
   - Import your S3 data → quick predictor → forecast 3–6 months.

5. **Clean Up**:
   - After each session: Stop notebook, delete small jobs, empty/delete bucket if testing.

### Why This Hits Your Targets Perfectly
- **#1 Data Science/ML**: Heavy Prophet/scikit-learn + optional Amazon Forecast.
- **#2 Performance/Capacity**: Simulates Citi monitoring data pipelines, forecasting, risk analysis.
- **#3 Python dev**: boto3, pandas, etc. + cloud integration.
- **AWS from resumes**: Shows hands-on cloud migration/analytics experience.

This will make your GitHub repo stand out — "Cloud-native recreation of enterprise capacity forecasting system, powered by AWS SageMaker, S3, Athena, and Forecast".
