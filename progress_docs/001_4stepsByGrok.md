### Suggested Next Steps (If You're Ready to Evolve)
- **Commit & Polish**: Push these to https://github.com/seanlgirgis/AWS-CapacityForecaster/docs/outbox. Add a quick README section: "SageMaker Integration Handover: See outbox/ for details on cloud migration."
- **Test Run**: From C:\pyproj\AWS-CapacityForecaster, try `python src/module_00_pipeline_runner.py --env sagemaker --only 04 05` to verify the jobs (monitor in AWS Console).
- **Enhancements (Low Effort)**: Add Amazon Forecast as a comparator in Module 04 (via boto3)—it could boost ML creds without much code.
- **Cost Check**: With your SuperGrok access, we can simulate a quick AWS cost estimate if needed (but based on the walkthrough, it'll be negligible).

If anything feels off or you want tweaks (e.g., add more visuals to the summary), just say the word—I'm here to iterate. Great progress; this strengthens the portfolio immensely! 🚀
