# Current Challenge: AutoGluon Dependency Conflicts
**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Component:** Module 04 - Model Training (`src/modules/module_04_model_training.py`)

## 1. The Issue (The "Failing" Step)
We were attempting to run the **AutoGluon** training job, but encountered severe dependency conflicts and runtime crashes. 

**Symptoms:**
*   `ModuleNotFoundError`: Python could not find AutoGluon sub-modules even after attempting installation.
*   **Version Incompatibility**: 
    *   Newer versions of `pandas` (2.x) and `numpy` (2.x) were breaking the specific version of `autogluon` we tried to use.
    *   SageMaker environments often come with pre-installed packages that conflict with what AutoGluon needs.

## 2. Proposed Resolution Plan
To solve this, we devised a strategy of **Isolation and Strict Version Pinning**, implemented in `module_04_model_training.py`.

### Step A: The "Wrapper" Strategy (Implemented)
Instead of running the training script directly, we created a **wrapper script** (`module_04_model_training.py`) that acts as a setup guard.
1.  **Does NOT import AutoGluon**: The wrapper itself only uses standard built-in libraries (`subprocess`, `sys`, `os`).
2.  **Installs Dependencies First**: It explicitly runs a `pip install` command with a very specific set of incompatible versions (see below) *before* the main code starts.
3.  **Launches Inner Process**: Only after installation succeeds does it use `subprocess` to launch the *actual* training script (`module_04_inner.py`). This ensures the new dependencies are loaded fresh from disk.

### Step B: The "Goldilocks" Dependency Set (To Be Tested)
We identified a specific combination of versions believed to work together. We are currently waiting to verifying if this specific list resolves the crash:
*   `pandas==2.1.4` (Compatible with PyArrow 14+)
*   `numpy<2.0.0` (Critical: AutoGluon currently breaks on Numpy 2.0)
*   `scikit-learn<1.5.0`
*   `scipy<1.13.0`
*   `autogluon>=1.1.0`

## 3. Immediate Next Steps
1.  Execute `src/modules/module_04_model_training.py`.
2.  Observe if the "Wrapper" successfully installs the `numpy<2.0.0` constraint without conflict.
3.  Verify if `module_04_inner.py` can successfully import `autogluon.tabular` without throwing a `ModuleNotFoundError`.
