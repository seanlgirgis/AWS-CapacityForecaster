Great question. Since we've standardized things, you now have two robust ways to access the project root in your Python scripts, and you should use them in this order of preference:

### 1\. The Environment Variable (Best for Runtime)

Since 

env_setter.ps1 (or your cloud environment configuration) sets 

```
$env:PROJECT_ROOT
```

, your Python code can simply grab it:

python

import os

from pathlib import Path

# Guaranteed way if env is set correctly

project_root = Path(os.environ['PROJECT_ROOT'])

-   Why use this? It's explicit. In AWS Lambda or SageMaker, you will set this env var in the configuration, so the code behaves identically everywhere.

### 2\. Relative Path (Best for "Just Works" Fallback)

If for some reason the environment variable isn't set (e.g. you opened the script directly in an IDE without running 

```
env_setter
```

), we can calculate it relative to the file itself. This is what we were doing before, but now we can make it a robust fallback logic in config.py.

### How src/utils/config.py does it (The Centralized Way)

You shouldn't actually need to recalculate 

```
project_root
```

 in every single script anymore. Instead, rely on config.py to do the heavy lifting for you.

Here is how 

src/utils/config.py works (or should be updated to work optimally):

python

# In src/utils/config.py

# 1. Try env var first

if  'PROJECT_ROOT'  in os.environ:

 PROJECT_ROOT = Path(os.environ['PROJECT_ROOT'])

else:

  # 2. Fallback: calculate relative to this file (config.py is in src/utils/)

  # So parents[2] takes us: src/utils/config.py -> src/utils/ -> src/ -> PROJECT_ROOT

 PROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]

### So, in your new scripts (like Module 02, etc.), you just do this:

python

from src.utils.config import PROJECT_ROOT

# Now you can use it confidently:

data_path = PROJECT_ROOT /  "data"  /  "raw"

This effectively abstracts the "how" away from your business logic. The script doesn't care if it's an env var or a relative path calculation; it just imports the constant.
