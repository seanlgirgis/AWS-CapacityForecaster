**The project that hits the most points** from your detailed CITI skill set (and comes closest to covering **almost all** the key libraries/techniques you used at Citi) is a **well-expanded version of Project #1: Server Resource Forecasting Dashboard** — evolved into a full **Enterprise Infrastructure Capacity Forecasting & Optimization System**.

This single project can realistically touch **nearly everything** you described in your 8-year Citi role:

### Why this one project covers the widest range (almost all)
- **Core ML Forecasting** (your biggest emphasis):  
  Time-series prediction of CPU/memory/disk/network 3–6 months ahead → **Prophet** (seasonality + holidays/banking peaks) + **scikit-learn** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting/XGBoost) + feature engineering (lags, rolling stats, external regressors like "end-of-quarter flag").

- **Data Pipeline & ETL heavy** (very Citi-like):  
  Generate → ingest → clean → transform large simulated monitoring CSVs/JSON (millions of rows) using **pandas** (DataFrames, groupby, merge, pivot), **numpy** (vectorized ops), **sqlalchemy** (simulate Oracle backup DB queries with window functions/joins).

- **Data Cleansing & Quality** (you stressed this):  
  Handle missing values, outliers, imputation (**pandas** interpolate + **scikit-learn** KNNImputer), anomaly detection (**scipy** z-score/percentiles), parallel processing (**joblib**).

- **Visualization & Reporting** (monthly/seasonal reports + dashboards):  
  Interactive executive views → **matplotlib** + **seaborn** (static) + **plotly** (interactive drill-downs, heatmaps, forecasts vs actual).  
  Export PDF/Excel reports → **reportlab** or **openpyxl**.

- **Optimization & Cost Insights** (underutilized detection):  
  Clustering (**scikit-learn** K-Means) on utilization patterns → recommend consolidation → calculate potential cost savings.

- **Advanced touches** (bonus depth):  
  Model evaluation (**statsmodels** ADF test for stationarity), parallel simulations (**joblib**), basic deployment (**dash**/Plotly Dash app for interactive what-if analysis).

→ **Hits ~95%+** of the Python/ML stack you described.  
The only things missing (that are harder in one small project) are very enterprise-specific integrations (TrueSight/AppDynamics APIs) — but you simulate them perfectly with generated data + SQLAlchemy.

### Quick Implementation Roadmap (to make it portfolio-ready fast)
1. Generate synthetic data (pandas + numpy): 50–100 "servers", 3–5 years daily/hourly metrics + seasonal peaks.
2. Build ETL pipeline → clean + feature engineer.
3. Train/compare models: baseline (average), Prophet, scikit-learn ensemble.
4. Risk analyzer + clustering for optimization.
5. Build visualizations + simple Dash app.
6. Document heavily (README, notebooks, metrics like "MAE reduced 25%", "processing 5x faster").
7. Put on GitHub as **"Enterprise-Capacity-Forecaster-CITI-Style"** — link it in resume as "Personal recreation of enterprise capacity forecasting system used at Citi".

This one strong project + your existing **Horizon ML repo** will powerfully back your **Data Science & ML** target, while still showing capacity planning depth.

If you want, I can help outline:
- Folder structure
- Sample data generation code
- Model comparison notebook skeleton
- Or even how to phrase the resume bullet with this GitHub link

Which part would you like to tackle first? This will give you the biggest "bang for buck" toward a killer portfolio. 🚀
