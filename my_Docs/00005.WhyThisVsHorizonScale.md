Here’s a clear, concise comparison between **AWS-CapacityForecaster** (this project) and **HorizonScale** / **HorizonStudy** (your previous/local high-performance ML project), written in a way that you can easily adapt for README, LinkedIn, resume notes, or conversations with recruiters.

### Key Differences – AWS-CapacityForecaster vs HorizonScale/HorizonStudy

| Aspect                              | HorizonScale / HorizonStudy                              | AWS-CapacityForecaster (current project)                              | Why it matters (portfolio value)                          |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Focus**                   | High-performance local ML experimentation & modeling      | Cloud-native enterprise capacity forecasting & planning             | Shows breadth: deep ML + realistic enterprise + cloud     |
| **Environment**                     | Local machine (powerful workstation/laptop)               | Hybrid: local dev + real AWS services (S3, SageMaker, Athena, ...)   | Demonstrates production-grade cloud skills (AWS)          |
| **Core Business Domain**            | General time-series ML, possibly broad use-cases          | Specific recreation of **enterprise IT capacity planning** (Citi-style) | Much stronger tie to your 8-year real-world Citi experience |
| **AWS / Cloud Integration**         | None / minimal                                            | Heavy & deliberate: S3 storage, Athena querying, SageMaker training, optional Amazon Forecast | Directly supports resume bullets: AWS, cloud analytics, migration |
| **Data Scale & Realism**            | Often synthetic or public datasets, research-oriented    | Synthetic but **enterprise-realistic**: 50–200 servers, P95 metrics, banking seasonality, multi-year history | Feels like real Citi monitoring pipelines (BMC TrueSight style) |
| **Deliverables / Output**           | Strong notebooks, model accuracy, maybe fast training     | Full capacity workflow: forecasts + **risk flagging** + **seasonal vulnerability** + **underutilization detection** + **cost/right-sizing recommendations** | Covers the whole capacity planning loop, not just ML      |
| **ML Philosophy**                   | Often pushing performance (speed, accuracy, large models)| Balanced: good accuracy + **explainability** + **business usefulness** (P95 risks, savings estimates) | More aligned with enterprise decision-making              |
| **Pipeline Style**                  | Mostly notebook-driven, experimental                      | Structured pipeline mindset: raw → processed → analytics → ML → insights | Shows you understand production data flow                 |
| **Deployment / Automation**         | Usually none                                              | Light cloud-native automation path (boto3, optional Lambda/EventBridge) | Modern, serverless-friendly architecture                  |
| **Portfolio Positioning**           | "Strong technical ML skills, handles large data locally" | "Enterprise capacity forecasting recreated in the cloud – Citi-inspired" | Much stronger story for Data Engineer / Capacity / Cloud roles |
| **Target Audience**                 | Data Scientist / ML Engineer roles                        | Broader: Data Scientist + Data Engineer + Cloud + Capacity Planning roles | Opens more doors, especially in financial/enterprise space |

### One-liner summaries (good for README or LinkedIn)

- **HorizonScale**  
  → "High-performance local time-series machine learning research and experimentation platform"

- **AWS-CapacityForecaster**  
  → "Cloud-native recreation of enterprise infrastructure capacity forecasting, risk analysis, and optimization system – directly inspired by 8 years of production work at Citi Financial, built with AWS SageMaker, S3, Athena, and modern Python ML stack"

### Bottom line – strategic positioning

**HorizonScale** proves you are a **strong, technical, hands-on ML practitioner** who can build fast, accurate models locally.

**AWS-CapacityForecaster** proves you are a **full-stack enterprise-minded professional** who understands the **business context** of capacity planning, knows how to productionize ML in the cloud, and can recreate real-world financial-industry workflows in a modern, clean, cloud-native way.

They complement each other beautifully on a portfolio:

- HorizonScale → deep technical chops & experimentation ability  
- AWS-CapacityForecaster → business relevance, cloud maturity, enterprise thinking

Both together make a very compelling story:  
"I can go very deep technically **and** I understand how to apply it in large-scale, regulated, business-critical environments using modern cloud architecture."

Let me know if you'd like help wording this comparison for the README (e.g. a small "How this differs from my other project" section) or for your resume narrative.
