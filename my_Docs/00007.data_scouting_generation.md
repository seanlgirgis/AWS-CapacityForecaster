You're absolutely right — scouting for **realistic public datasets** is a smart parallel move at this stage, especially since the project aims to feel like a Citi-inspired enterprise system with believable patterns (seasonality, banking peaks, multi-server variance, occasional spikes/outliers). Relying **only** on fully synthetic data risks looking too "clean" or artificial in a portfolio piece, while mixing in (or adapting) public traces adds credibility and lets you demonstrate handling messier, real-world-ish data.

That said, the sweet spot for this project is **hybrid**:  
- Use **synthetic generation** (your existing utils) as the **primary, controllable backbone** — you can scale servers, inject seasonality/holidays/critical peaks, simulate underutilized vs. at-risk hosts, and keep everything private/compliant-friendly.  
- Supplement/augment with **public datasets** for realism — e.g., derive patterns, validate distributions (CPU rarely >90% sustained, memory often spiky), or even use subsets as "historical baseline" for some servers.

### Quick Assessment of Public Options (from current open sources)
Very few perfect matches exist for "daily/ hourly P95 CPU/mem/disk per-server over years in enterprise/banking context" — most public cloud traces are either:

- **Cluster/Job-level** (not per-server utilization) → Google Cluster Traces (2011/2019 versions), Alibaba Cluster Trace 2018, Azure Public Dataset v2 — great for large-scale but require heavy extraction to get per-machine time series.
- **Aggregate or short-period** → Many are 5-min samples over weeks/months, not years.
- **Kaggle-focused singles** — Often small (one EC2 instance over 1 day) or simulated/unclean.

**Top realistic candidates worth downloading/exploring now** (prioritized for your needs):

1. **EC2 Instance Metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk Usage)** – Kaggle  
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakthivelank/ec2-instance-metricscpumemory-and-disk-usage  
   → Time-series from one AWS EC2 over 1 full day (likely high-frequency). Small but real cloud flavor; good for validation patterns or feature ideas.

2. **Dataset System Resources CPU RAM Disk Network** – Kaggle  
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omnamahshivai/dataset-system-resources-cpu-ram-disk-network  
   → Multi-resource time series; check length & # of entities.

3. **Westermo test system performance dataset** – GitHub  
   https://github.com/westermo/test-system-performance-dataset  
   → 19 CSV files, 23–24 metrics incl. CPU/memory sampled ~twice per minute over test periods. Industrial/server-like; tabular & clean-ish.

4. **Google Cluster Data** (esp. version with machine events + usage)  
   Widely used; extract per-machine CPU/mem series from task_usage table. Classic for capacity/forecasting papers.

5. **Alibaba Microservices / PAI traces** (from recent surveys)  
   High-scale node-level CPU/mem utilization; realistic datacenter patterns (often low–mid utilization with spikes).

Others (lower priority): BitBrain (small grid hosts), Azure Public VM metrics, various Kaggle "CPU utilization" sets (often univariate/single series).

**Recommendation**:  
- **Don't pivot away from synthetic** — it's your control layer for seasonal banking risks, P95 thresholds, cost-optimization stories.  
- **Do start scouting/downloading 2–3 now** (e.g., the Kaggle EC2 one + Westermo GitHub + perhaps Google/Alibaba if you want scale).  
- Use them to:  
  - Compare distributions (e.g., `df_public.cpu_p95.hist()` vs. your synthetic)  
  - Calibrate generation params (real servers rarely average >60–70% sustained)  
  - Optionally blend: e.g., take real patterns for 10–20 "servers" and synthetic for the rest.

### Proposed Balanced Next Steps (parallel tracks)
Do **both** scouting + synthetic advancement together — keeps momentum high.

1. **Data Scouting / Acquisition Track** (low effort, high value)  
   - Download & inspect 2–3 quick ones today:  
     - Kaggle EC2 metrics (tiny, fast)  
     - Westermo GitHub CSVs  
     - One Kaggle multi-resource set  
   - In a new notebook `notebooks/00_data_exploration_public.ipynb`:  
     Load → describe stats → plot sample series → compute utilization histograms/P95 → note patterns (seasonality? daily/weekly? spikes?).  
   - Commit findings to README ("Data Sources" section: synthetic primary + public for realism calibration).

2. **Synthetic Enhancement Track** (core priority #1 & #2)  
   - Evolve your generation utils to be **more Citi-like** using insights from public data:  
     - Add realistic low baseline + quarterly spikes (end-of-quarter = +20–40% CPU/mem for "fin" tagged servers)  
     - Inject holiday effects (US banking holidays via Prophet-style)  
     - Vary per-server profiles: some always <30% (underutilized candidates), some bursty, some steady high.  
   - Run larger generation: 80–120 servers × 4 years daily → save as Parquet in `data/raw/` or direct to S3 via boto3.  
   - Start the forecasting notebook I sketched earlier, but now feed it this improved synthetic + optionally concatenate/augment with a public subset.

3. **Bridge to AWS** (priority #3, still light)  
   - Once you have v2 synthetic (or hybrid), upload a sample (~100 MB Parquet) to your S3 bucket using existing utils.  
   - Test Athena external table on it (simulate "Oracle backup DB" queries) — e.g., `SELECT server_id, AVG(cpu_p95) FROM table GROUP BY server_id`.

**Which direction feels right to tackle first / next 1–2 days?**  
- Dive into downloading + exploring 1–2 public sets (I can give code snippets for loading/analyzing them)  
- Enhance synthetic generation first (more seasonal/risk features)  
- Start hybrid in a notebook (generate synthetic + overlay patterns from public)  
- Jump straight to S3 upload + Athena test with current data
