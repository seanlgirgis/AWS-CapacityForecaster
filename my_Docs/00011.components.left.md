Here is a clear, prioritized breakdown of **what is still missing / incomplete** in the **AWS-CapacityForecaster** project — organized by logical component (file, script, notebook, module, etc.).

For each component I list:
- **Current status** (brief)
- **Target functionality** to be achieved
- **Priority** (High / Medium / Low) — based on how central it is to the three core targets (ML → Capacity Planning → AWS/cloud)

### 1. Main Orchestration / Pipeline Runner
- **Suggested file**: `src/main.py` or `src/pipeline.py`
- **Current status**: Missing (only notebooks + small demo scripts)
- **Target functionality**:
  - Single entry-point script that can run the full end-to-end flow:
    1. Load config
    2. Generate or load data from S3
    3. Run ETL + feature engineering
    4. Train / load models → generate forecasts
    5. Run risk analysis + clustering
    6. Create visualizations + export reports (PDF/Excel/JSON)
    7. Upload results back to S3
  - Support command-line arguments / modes:
    - `--generate-data`
    - `--train`
    - `--forecast`
    - `--full-pipeline`
    - `--local` vs `--aws`
  - Proper logging (structured + file + console)
  - Graceful error handling & exit codes
- **Priority**: **High** — without this the project stays notebook-only (exploratory) rather than production-like / portfolio-ready

### 2. Serverless Lambda Handler
- **Suggested file**: `src/lambda_handler.py`
- **Current status**: Mentioned in config/env overrides, but no implementation
- **Target functionality**:
  - Lambda-compatible entry point (def lambda_handler(event, context))
  - Triggered by:
    - S3 object creation (new raw data uploaded)
    - EventBridge schedule (daily/weekly forecast refresh)
  - Lightweight version: load config → run forecast only on latest data → save results to S3
  - Optional: return small JSON summary (MAE of last forecast, number of at-risk servers, etc.)
  - Environment variable / SSM parameter support for config overrides
- **Priority**: **High** — this is the single biggest step toward true cloud-native / serverless maturity

### 3. SageMaker Processing / Training Job Scripts
- **Suggested files**:
  - `src/sagemaker/processing_entry.py`
  - `src/sagemaker/training_entry.py` (or use script mode with existing notebooks)
- **Current status**: SageMaker dependencies exist, but no dedicated entry points
- **Target functionality**:
  - Processing job: full ETL + feature engineering on large dataset (pandas inside container)
  - Training job: train Prophet / scikit-learn models in SageMaker (script mode)
  - Accept input channels (S3 paths), output channels (save model artifacts + forecasts to S3)
  - Use SageMaker hyperparameters → override config values (e.g., forecast horizon, model type)
- **Priority**: **High** — moves from notebook experimentation → proper SageMaker ML workflow (very strong for resume)

### 4. Model Persistence & Loading Logic
- **Suggested location**: `src/models/` module or `src/utils/model_utils.py`
- **Current status**: models/ folder mostly empty
- **Target functionality**:
  - Save trained Prophet & scikit-learn models to S3 (joblib / pickle / prophet native format)
  - Load pre-trained models from S3 for forecasting (avoid retraining every time)
  - Versioning support (simple: timestamp or git commit hash in filename)
  - Compare new forecast vs previous model version (drift detection light)
- **Priority**: **High** — essential for realistic enterprise reuse & cost control

### 5. End-to-End Results & Metrics Reporting
- **Suggested files**:
  - `src/reporting/generate_report.py`
  - `src/reporting/export.py` (PDF / Excel helpers)
- **Current status**: reports/ folder exists but likely empty / minimal
- **Target functionality**:
  - Aggregate model performance (MAE / RMSE / MAPE per server / overall)
  - Risk summary: count & list of high-risk / very-high-risk servers by BU / region
  - Clustering summary: number of servers per cluster + recommended actions
  - Cost savings estimate: “Consolidating cluster 0 → potential X% reduction”
  - Export:
    - PDF executive summary (matplotlib/seaborn/plotly figures + tables)
    - Excel with detailed forecasts + risk flags
    - JSON summary for downstream systems / Lambda return
- **Priority**: **High** — this is what executives / capacity managers actually consume

### 6. Athena Table Creation & Query Helpers
- **Suggested file**: `src/athena/setup.py` or `notebooks/06_athena_queries.ipynb`
- **Current status**: Athena config exists, but no table DDL or example queries
- **Target functionality**:
  - Create external tables over S3 prefixes (raw, processed, forecasts, risks)
  - Example parameterized queries:
    - “Show servers with P95 CPU > 80% last 30 days”
    - “Average forecast utilization next 90 days by business unit”
  - Simple Python wrapper to run queries via boto3 & return pandas DataFrame
- **Priority**: **Medium-High** — strengthens the “Oracle backup DB simulation” narrative

### 7. CI/CD & Deployment Automation (IaC light)
- **Suggested files**:
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
  - `infrastructure/cdk/` (if using CDK) or simple bash/PowerShell scripts
- **Current status**: None visible
- **Target functionality**:
  - GitHub Actions:
    - lint + test on push
    - run notebooks headlessly → generate reports
    - (optional) deploy CDK stack
  - Basic CDK app that creates: S3 bucket, Athena workgroup, IAM roles
- **Priority**: **Medium** — nice to have for cloud-native polish, but not strictly required for MVP portfolio

### 8. Interactive Dashboard (Dash / Streamlit)
- **Suggested location**: `src/dashboard/app.py`
- **Current status**: plotly exists, but no web app
- **Target functionality**:
  - Select server / BU / metric
  - Show historical + forecast + risk flags
  - What-if sliders (change growth rate, see impact on forecast)
  - Deployable to SageMaker / Lambda + API Gateway (stretch)
- **Priority**: **Medium** — very impressive visually, but lower priority than core pipeline

### Summary – Recommended Next 4 Steps (in order)

| Order | Component                          | Why first?                                          | Est. effort |
|------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1    | `src/main.py` (or pipeline.py)     | Turns notebooks into reusable pipeline               | 1–2 days    |
| 2    | Model save/load logic              | Enables reuse, versioning, cost control              | ½–1 day     |
| 3    | Reporting & export script          | Produces tangible portfolio assets (PDFs, metrics)   | 1–2 days    |
| 4    | Lambda handler                     | Biggest single cloud-native maturity jump            | 1–2 days    |

Would you like me to help draft the skeleton / initial code for any of these four highest-priority items first?

(Just say e.g. “start with main pipeline script” or “help me write the reporting module”)
