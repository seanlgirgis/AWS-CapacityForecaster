Based on the project flow, here's where you stand and what comes next:

Current Status
--------------

✅ **Data Generation Complete** --- 120 servers with realistic synthetic metrics (CPU, memory, disk_io, network) across 4 years with growth trends, diurnal patterns, quarterly seasonality, and correlated noise.

Next Stages in the Pipeline
---------------------------

| Stage | Description | Key Files/Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1\. Data Upload to S3** | Push generated CSVs to S3 bucket with proper partitioning (by date or server_type) | `boto3`, S3 bucket |
| **2\. Data Validation/EDA** | Verify patterns look realistic --- plot samples, check correlations, confirm quarterly spikes | Jupyter notebook, matplotlib/seaborn |
| **3\. Feature Engineering** | Create ML-ready features: lags, rolling means, `days_to_quarter_end`, `is_business_hour`, trend decomposition | pandas, possibly a `feature_engineering.py` |
| **4\. Model Training** | Train forecasting models --- Prophet (seasonal), XGBoost (feature-based), optionally Amazon Forecast | Prophet, scikit-learn, SageMaker |
| **5\. Model Evaluation** | Compare accuracy (MAE, RMSE), especially during peak periods (Q-end) | Cross-validation, holdout test set |
| **6\. Capacity Risk Flagging** | Flag servers predicted to exceed thresholds (e.g., P95 > 85%) in next 30/90 days | Risk classification logic |
| **7\. Reporting/Dashboard** | Visualize forecasts, at-risk servers, recommendations | Streamlit, QuickSight, or static reports |

Recommended Next Step
---------------------

**Stage 1: Upload to S3** --- This unlocks the AWS-native workflow (Athena queries, SageMaker training, Glue catalog).

Would you like to:

-   **"Set up S3 upload"** --- I'll help you write the boto3 code to upload with partitioning
-   **"Do EDA first"** --- Create a notebook to validate the generated data before uploading
-   **"Jump to feature engineering"** --- Start building the ML feature pipeline locally first
