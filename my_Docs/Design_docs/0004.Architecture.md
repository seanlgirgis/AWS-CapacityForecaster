# System Architecture Diagram - AWS-CapacityForecaster

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 17, 2026  
**Author**: Sean Girgis  

## Purpose
This document presents the high-level system architecture for **AWS-CapacityForecaster**, a cloud-native recreation of enterprise server capacity forecasting and optimization workflows (inspired by 8 years at Citi Financial).  

The architecture is designed to be:
- **Cost-effective** (leverages Free Tier + short-lived resources)
- **Serverless/managed-first** (minimal infrastructure management)
- **Focused on ML & capacity planning** (SageMaker for models, Athena for querying, S3 as central data hub)
- **Extensible** (easy to add automation later)

It supports the three core project targets:
1. **Data Science / ML** → Time-series forecasting with Prophet, scikit-learn, optional Amazon Forecast
2. **Capacity Planning** → Risk flagging, seasonal analysis, underutilization clustering, cost recommendations
3. **Python + AWS** → boto3 orchestration, SageMaker notebooks/jobs, Athena SQL queries

## High-Level Architecture Overview

The system follows a classic **data lake + ML pipeline** pattern:

1. Local / notebook-based synthetic data generation → upload to **S3**
2. ETL/feature engineering → processed data back to **S3**
3. Query/analysis with **Athena** (simulates Oracle backup DB access)
4. ML training & forecasting in **SageMaker** (notebooks + processing/training jobs)
5. Results → risk analysis, clustering, visualizations → reports/dashboards
6. (Future) Serverless automation via **Lambda** + **EventBridge**
