**The repository https://github.com/seanlgirgis/AWS-CapacityForecaster implements a cloud-native enterprise-grade capacity forecasting and optimization tool inspired by large-scale banking systems (e.g., Citi's monitoring, capacity planning, and ML forecasting work).**

It simulates/analyzes server metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network P95 utilization), generates realistic Citi-style synthetic data (seasonality, weekly dips, annual cycles, end-of-quarter/EOQ spikes, US banking holidays via holidays.US, business unit/criticality/region metadata), performs ETL/cleansing/feature engineering (lags, rolling windows, calendar features like is_eoq/is_weekend), trains/evaluates ML forecasting models, conducts risk analysis (P95 thresholds: high ≥80%, very high ≥90%; underutilized ≤40%), supports clustering (K-Means n=4 on P95 metrics for consolidation recommendations), and includes visualizations/reports.

**Key AWS integration**: S3 (raw/processed/features prefixes, boto3 load/save with compression), Athena (database/workgroup config), SageMaker (in dependencies + env support), optional Lambda compatibility via config/env overrides. Local dev supported (Jupyter, PowerShell env_setter.ps1).

**Project structure highlights** (47 commits, notebooks ~62% of codebase):
- **src/utils/**: config.py (YAML + .env + env overrides for local/SageMaker/Lambda, strict validation); **data_utils.py** (synthetic generation, S3/local load, validate/clean/anomaly detection via z-score/KNN, resample, calendar features, merge metadata).
- **notebooks/**: Phased exploratory/implementation: 01_data_generation.ipynb, 02_etl_pipeline.ipynb, 03_ml_forecasting.ipynb, 04_risk_analysis.ipynb, 05_visualization.ipynb.
- **config/**: config.yaml (120 servers, 4 years daily data 2022–2025, P95 realistic ranges, seasonality/EOQ/holidays enabled, ML params for Prophet + RF + GB, eval metrics MAE/RMSE/MAPE + CV, feature eng, risk/clustering thresholds, Athena/S3 paths).
- Other: tests/, demos/ (e.g., demo_config.py), requirements.txt (pandas/numpy/scipy/pyarrow; scikit-learn/prophet/statsmodels; matplotlib/seaborn/plotly/dash/reportlab/openpyxl; boto3/sagemaker/moto; joblib/pyyaml/python-dotenv/pytest/jupyter), reports/, docs/my_Docs/ (limited visible content), models/ (minimal/empty).

**Dependencies align closely with Citi experience**: Heavy pandas/numpy/scipy for ETL/cleansing/anomalies; scikit-learn/prophet/statsmodels for models/feature eng/stationarity; plotly/dash/reportlab/openpyxl for interactive dashboards/PDF/Excel reports; boto3/sagemaker for cloud; joblib for potential parallel; etc. (sqlalchemy/holidays may be implicit or added).

**Target (from repo + provided planning docs)**: Recreate/expand Citi-inspired Enterprise Infrastructure Capacity Forecasting & Optimization System as a portfolio piece. Generate Citi-like telemetry (P95, seasonality/EOQ/holidays/banking cycles from thousands of endpoints), build automated ETL pipelines, develop/train/compare ML forecasts (Prophet for time-series + seasonality/holidays; scikit-learn RF/GB/XGBoost ensembles with lags/rolling/external regressors; baseline comparison, 20–30% accuracy gains targeted), risk/seasonal analysis (P95 at-risk flagging, prioritization by criticality/BU), optimization (K-Means clustering for underutilized detection → consolidations/right-sizing → cost savings), visualizations/dashboards/reports (plotly/dash interactive, matplotlib/seaborn static, exports), all while integrating low-cost AWS (S3 storage/ETL, Athena SQL-on-S3 simulating Oracle backup DB, SageMaker notebooks/jobs for ML, optional Lambda/EventBridge automation, Amazon Forecast). Mirror Citi Python stack for data engineering/ML/automation in regulated finance; showcase AWS/cloud analytics/migration skills. Keep synthetic data small-scale for low cost (Free Tier/SageMaker Studio/short jobs). (Matches provided "00001.Project1_planning.md", "00002.aws_added_To_Project1.md", citi.md experience.)

**What was accomplished / what was done**:
- Solid modular foundation: Config-driven (multi-env, validation), comprehensive data_utils (synthetic gen with exact Citi-inspired elements: EOQ spikes, seasonality, holidays, metadata, P95 clipping, quality validation <5% missing, outlier/anomaly detection, cleaning/interpolation per server, calendar features, S3 integration).
- Notebook-based SDLC-aligned pipeline covering key phases: data gen, ETL/feature eng/cleansing, ML forecasting (Prophet + RF + GB configured with CV/metrics/eval; features as planned), risk analysis, visualization.
- AWS readiness: S3 paths/prefixes/bucket config, Athena DB/workgroup, SageMaker deps/env support, moto for testing.
- Testing/demo infrastructure, requirements covering ~95%+ of targeted Citi libraries/techniques (pandas/numpy/scipy/sklearn/prophet/statsmodels/plotly/dash/joblib/etc.).
- Scale: 120 servers × 4 years daily (~175k rows), realistic P95 ranges, feature eng (lags/rolling/EOQ), risk/clustering params all configured.
- Alignment with planning: Hits synthetic data/ETL/ML/risk/viz/optimization setup, AWS stack (S3/Athena/SageMaker focus; Forecast optional/disabled).

**Are we hitting all the marks as planned?** Yes, very strongly on **foundation and components** (~80–90% coverage of core goals from planning docs and config). Data layer is robust/Citi-accurate; ML models/config match exactly (Prophet + sklearn ensembles vs baseline, targeted metrics/CV, features); risk/clustering thresholds present; AWS integration basics (S3/Athena/SageMaker) implemented at config/code level; notebooks provide phased proof-of-concept. Synthetic data + config make it highly realistic/reproducible for portfolio. Matches Citi emphasis on ETL (pandas cleansing/imputation/outliers), forecasting (Prophet/scikit-learn with seasonality/holidays/EOQ), risk/seasonal analysis (P95/percentiles), viz/reporting (plotly/dash/exports), optimization (clustering). Low-cost AWS strategy followed.

**What is left / gaps for completion**:
- End-to-end orchestration: Main script/pipeline runner (beyond notebooks/demos); full automated flow (data gen/load → ETL → train/forecast → risk/cluster → report/viz/export); Lambda/EventBridge scheduled runs.
- Deeper AWS deployment/production: Actual SageMaker Processing/Training jobs (vs notebooks), inference endpoints, Lambda functions, Athena table creation/queries (simulating Oracle backup), QuickSight dashboards, S3 uploads + real runs (with cleanup/budgets).
- Advanced features: Amazon Forecast integration (currently disabled); full cost-savings calculations from clustering consolidations/right-sizing; comprehensive anomaly detection (KNN in config but extent unclear); parallel processing (joblib); what-if analysis in Dash app.
- SDLC artifacts (per provided 000001.SDLC.md): Full SRS/BRD, architecture diagram (ERD/system), UI/UX wireframes, API/Swagger if backend, Test Plan/Traceability Matrix (RTM mapping requirements to tests), Deployment Checklist, User Manual, Post-Mortem. (docs/ and my_Docs/ have limited visible content; planning docs exist separately.)
- Polish & completeness: Saved/trained models (models/ sparse), populated reports/ with outputs/metrics (e.g., MAE/RMSE/MAPE improvements 20–30%, plots of forecasts vs actual, risk flags, clustering results/savings), expanded README (screenshots, results, accuracy claims, setup with AWS creds/IAM), license, releases, more tests (unit/integration for full pipeline), scalability/performance benchmarks (millions of rows handling).
- Production/maintainability: Logging/monitoring enhancements, error handling, security (IAM least-privilege), cost monitoring, larger-scale tests, migration to real monitoring extracts if desired.
- Notebooks may be exploratory (content extraction limited); ensure they produce documented results/metrics matching planned gains.

**Overall balance / status**: The project has a **strong, professional foundation** that closely recreates the targeted Citi-inspired system and AWS integration—excellent for a portfolio piece demonstrating Python data engineering, ML forecasting, capacity/risk analysis, and cloud skills. Data + config + notebooks hit the hardest/most distinctive parts (Citi realism, phased pipeline, AWS readiness). With 47 commits and modular design, it's well beyond initial planning and demonstrates significant accomplishment. However, it remains **notebook-heavy/exploratory rather than fully orchestrated/production-deployed**; integration, deployment, full optimization calc/reports, and SDLC documentation would elevate it to "complete" and showcase end-to-end enterprise capability. Prioritize orchestration script + AWS job runs + results documentation + key SDLC artifacts next for maximum impact. This positions it well as a "personal recreation of enterprise capacity forecasting used at Citi, powered by AWS S3/SageMaker/Athena" resume/GitHub bullet.
