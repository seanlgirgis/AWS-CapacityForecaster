**Yes, we should create a dedicated document for Data Sourcing & Generation Strategy.**

This is an excellent next step after the high-level requirements — it directly impacts the realism of your capacity planning simulations, the quality of your ML models, and how convincingly the project mirrors your Citi experience (where you worked with real, high-volume telemetry from thousands of endpoints).

Having a separate doc keeps the high-level requirements clean while allowing deeper discussion of trade-offs, realism vs. simplicity, licensing, and long-term maintainability.

### Recommended Document Name & Location

**File name**:  
`docs/02-data-sourcing-generation.md`

**Full local path**:  
`C:\pyproj\AWS-CapacityForecaster\docs\02-data-sourcing-generation.md`

**Why this naming?**  
- Sequential numbering (after `01-high-level-requirements.md`) makes it easy to follow the project's documentation flow  
- Clear, descriptive title  
- Markdown for easy GitHub rendering and future updates

### Why a separate document makes sense here

- Data decisions are foundational and have long-term implications (model accuracy, seasonal patterns, risk analysis realism)  
- There are meaningful trade-offs between **real public datasets** (more authentic but messy/complex) and **synthetic generation** (full control, easy to reproduce, privacy-safe)  
- This doc can evolve independently (e.g., add new sources later) without bloating the main requirements file  
- Recruiters reviewing your repo will appreciate seeing thoughtful data strategy — it shows enterprise thinking

### Current Recommendation: Hybrid Approach (Synthetic + Optional Real Traces)

After reviewing available public options, here's the realistic landscape for server metrics (CPU/memory/disk/network utilization time-series):

**Strong public datasets exist** (especially cluster traces), but they come with caveats for our exact use-case:

| Dataset/Source                          | Realism Level | Time Granularity | Duration | # Servers/Hosts | Key Metrics                          | Ease of Use | Drawbacks for our project                              | Verdict for v1 |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------|------------------|----------|------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Alibaba Cluster Trace (2017/2018/2021)  | Very high     | ~seconds-minutes | 8 days – 12h | 1.3k–4k+        | CPU%, mem%, disk I/O, tasks/containers | Medium      | Batch + online co-location, not pure server metrics; huge files (50–270GB+); complex schema | Great reference, but too heavy for MVP |
| Google Cluster Workload Traces (2019+)  | High          | 5 min            | Months   | Thousands       | CPU/mem request/usage, disk, events   | Medium      | Task/job-oriented, not clean per-server time-series | Useful for patterns, not direct fit |
| TSBS (Timescale Time Series Benchmark)  | Medium-High   | Configurable     | Generated| Configurable    | CPU, mem, disk, network (~100 metrics)| High        | Fully synthetic but realistic patterns; easy to generate | Strong candidate as "realistic synthetic" baseline |
| MIT Supercloud Dataset                  | High          | Per-minute       | Long     | HPC cluster     | CPU/GPU, mem, file system             | Medium      | HPC-focused (GPU heavy), not typical enterprise servers | Interesting but niche |
| Others (BitBrain, Westermo, etc.)       | Medium        | 5 min – minutes  | 30 days+ | Small–medium    | CPU%, mem%, disk I/O, network         | High        | Smaller scale, older, or VM-focused                  | Good for inspiration/validation |

**Bottom line for AWS-CapacityForecaster**  
Real public datasets are **valuable for validation/inspiration** (seasonality, distribution of peaks, multi-modal behavior), but **not ideal as the primary source** for a clean, portfolio-focused project because:
- They are massive/complex → hard to clean & process in a "portfolio-friendly" way
- Often batch/job-oriented rather than pure server-level P95 daily metrics
- Licensing/access hurdles (some require registration/questionnaires)
- Hard to control seasonality/holidays that match banking cycles

**Recommended strategy (best balance for your priorities)**:

1. **Primary: Controlled Synthetic Generation** (80–100% of data for training/analysis)  
   - Use pandas + numpy + scipy to create realistic daily P95 time-series  
   - Inject banking-like seasonality (end-of-month/quarter peaks, holiday dips)  
   - Add noise, trends, weekly patterns, random server behaviors  
   - 50–200 servers × 3–5 years → perfect scale for ML experiments + AWS demos  
   → Full control, reproducible, low friction, matches Citi-style reporting

2. **Secondary: Use real traces for validation & inspiration** (optional, bonus depth)  
   - Download a subset of **Alibaba cluster-trace-v2018** machine_usage table (CPU/mem % per machine per timestamp)  
   - Or TSBS-generated data (very easy to run locally)  
   - Use to tune your synthetic generator (match real statistical distributions) or run side-by-side comparisons ("Our synthetic forecasts achieve similar error rates as on Alibaba real data")

3. **Never use real data as sole source** — keeps the project clean, self-contained, and easy to run for anyone reviewing your GitHub

### Suggested Outline for `docs/02-data-sourcing-generation.md`

```markdown
# 02 – Data Sourcing & Generation Strategy

**Version**: 0.1 – Draft  
**Status**: In progress

## 1. Goals for Data
- Realistic enough to demonstrate Citi-like capacity planning (seasonality, peaks, P95 risks)
- Reproducible and fast to generate (portfolio-friendly)
- Suitable for time-series ML (clean timestamps, multiple features)
- Low friction (no huge downloads, no complex ETL upfront)

## 2. Decision: Primary → Synthetic Generation
- Why: Full control over patterns, seasonality (banking calendar), scale, and cleanliness
- How: pandas/numpy/scipy for time-series + custom functions for:
  - Base trend + weekly cycle
  - End-of-month/quarter spikes
  - Random server groups (high/low utilization)
  - Noise/outliers/missing values

## 3. Validation with Real-World Traces (Optional)
- Alibaba Cluster Trace v2018 (machine_usage table) – subset only
- TSBS benchmark data generator
- Purpose: Tune synthetic params, show comparison in notebooks

## 4. Target Data Specs
- 50–200 servers
- 3–5 years daily data (P95 CPU/mem/disk/network)
- Columns: timestamp, server_id, cpu_p95, mem_p95, disk_p95, ...
- ~100k–500k rows total (light for AWS + local)

## 5. Future Options
- Add hourly data later
- Incorporate Alibaba/Google patterns for advanced analysis

Next steps: Finalize synthetic data schema in next doc/notebook
```

This keeps things pragmatic while showing thoughtful consideration — exactly what makes a strong portfolio project.
